<few_shot_examples>

<example_1>
INPUT: "I want to create content about someone finally getting treatment for hemorrhoids after avoiding doctors for 15 years"

REASONING_PROCESS:

HOOK_ANALYSIS:
- Question raised: "Why did someone avoid treatment for 15 years?"
- Conflict: Fear vs. necessity
- Stakes: Health emergency situation
- Power words: "bleeding," "almost fainted," "afraid"

SUGGESTED_HOOK: "เป็นริซซี่เลือดไหลจนเกือบสลบ เพราะไม่กล้าเจอหมอ! จนอยากบอกทุกคนว่า…"
Translation: "Had hemorrhoids bleeding until almost fainting because afraid to see doctor! Until wanting to tell everyone that..."

STORY_STRUCTURE_HERO_JOURNEY:
- Before: 15 years of hemorrhoids, discomfort, shame, fear of doctors
- Max Pain: Bleeding until fainting in bathroom, fear of dying
- Change: Realization that treatment is necessary before another episode
- Resistance: Still afraid due to past bad experiences
- Breakthrough: Child's support - "Don't be afraid mom, I'll go to hospital with you"
- After: Different doctor experience, kind doctor, painless treatment, relief, child's happiness

PAYOFF: Friends surprising at bedside + sharing that they're no longer worried + mother hugging child while crying

VISUAL_PROGRESSION: Bathroom incident → fear/hesitation → child's encouragement → hospital visit → treatment → emotional reunion

STAKES: Life-threatening health emergency, single mother responsibilities, fear of leaving child alone

- Conflict: Desperation vs. hope
- Unrealistic element: "Tried everything" suggests impossibility of solution

SUGGESTED_HOOK: "ลองรักษาสิวมาแล้วทุกวิธี จนมาเจอสิ่งนี้! สิวเรื้อรังหายได้จริง ไม่ทิ้งรอย"
Translation: "Tried every acne treatment method until finding this! Chronic acne really can heal without scarring"

STORY_STRUCTURE_FOLLOW_ME_PLUS_BUT_SO:
- Follow Me: "Watch my skin transformation over 30 days"
- But-So Chain:
  * Tried expensive treatments BUT didn't work SO tried home remedies
  * Bought recommended products BUT made it worse SO felt hopeless
  * Found new method BUT was skeptical SO researched extensively
  * Started treatment BUT initial breakout occurred SO almost quit
  * Continued anyway BUT slow progress SO documented everything
  * Day 15 breakthrough SO gained confidence SO continued religiously

PAYOFF: Clear skin reveal + side-by-side comparison + emotional reaction

STAKES: Self-confidence, social anxiety, career implications, financial waste

VISUAL_PROGRESSION: Before photos → failed treatments montage → research phase → daily documentation → breakthrough moment → final reveal
